## Resources
### Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
Optical character recognition was implemented with the TesseractJS library, a _wrapper_ for the [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) engine programmed in C++. The library supports more than 100 languages, including Portuguese.
### Native features (CapacitorJS)
The application is able to access the device's native functionalities, such as the camera and gallery, to perform optical character recognition.
